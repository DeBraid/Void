## Inspiration

Transform the paper-based product catalogue into digital version.

### TO DO 


1. Other Resources: flyers (as PDF), General Info as PDF, "Pages for Canada", accessories 
-- most of this will be PDFs, need them!
-- rename "Other" to Resources 

2.  Heart and Globe Palettes?

3.  Sort priority: 
  a.  Size
  b.  see Catalogue layout

4.  Each Page needs Images
-- move the table over to say col-7, on left insert the palette or valid img

5.  Homepage design makeover
  a.  set up large images w/ links to sections (duplicate nav, but visually)
  b.  see pioneer.com for template (also request these images)
