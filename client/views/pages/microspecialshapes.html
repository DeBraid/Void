        <h4>The power of point-of-purchase displays is increased with the use of special-shape Microfoil balloons.</h4>
        <p>They add colour and motion to any display to boost brand recognition and increase
         sales without the loss of floor space.  Contact Customer Service for price quotes.</p>
         
         <p>Pricing will depend on the number of colours, if balloons are printed on one side or two sides,
         and the overall size and shape of the balloon.  Normal minimums: 5,000 balloons per shape and per design</p>
